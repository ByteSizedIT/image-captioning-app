'''automated image captioning program that works directly from a URL. The user provides the URL, and the code generates captions for the images found on the webpage. The output is a text file that includes all the image URLs along with their respective captions (like the image below).

'''
1.send a HTTP request to the provided URL and retrieve the webpage's content. 
2. content is parsed by BeautifulSoup, which creates a parse tree from page's HTML.
3. look for 'img' tags in parse tree - they contain the links to the images hosted on the webpage.'''

        Analytics / Ad beacons â†’ To record page impressions, user activity, etc.
        Icons, on the other hand, are typically larger (16Ã—16, 32Ã—32, 64Ã—64, etc.) and are meant to be visible to the user. A 1Ã—1 is basically too small to be useful as an icon â€” itâ€™s effectively invisible to the naked eye.'''
